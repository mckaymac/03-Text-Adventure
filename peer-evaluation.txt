Project: Peer evaluation on the Text adventure
Peer's repository: Mckaymac

What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
That they created a dream where they were walking around their childhood home again.
Where they are dreaming of themselves dreaming.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
There were no syntax errors preventing it for running correctly.
 I would include more directionary verbs as they did.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I would nicely suggest choosing a more creative setting than just a normal house with normal things inside. 
 
What could have been clearer or better commented?
What could have been clearer is what you could actually do, besides just walk around.
In my opinion they did not really include much to do except walk around.
So, I think that they could have better commented more available activities in these rooms.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
No, nothing was confusing besides the lack of activites available in the rooms besides walking for the most part.
Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes, it does.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Well, they could include a description fo the story. 
As well as a description of the background of the game.
They could also give a general description of what is in the story too.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
This person wrote a good description of each of the rooms.
